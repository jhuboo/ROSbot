As part of this class, I am learning how to build and program robots.
The first major class project consists of building a Raspbery-Pi based, 
two-wheeled, robotic platform.

Below is picture of the final ROSBot. 

It's called 'a2j2'.

The build process can be seen by browsing the images directory, and videos
of moving ROSBot can be seen in the videos directory.
