As part of this class, I am learning how to build and program robots.
The first major class project consists of building a Raspbery-Pi based, 
two-wheeled, robotic platform.

Below is picture of the final ROSBot. 
It's called 'a2j2\_not\_r2d2'. Not a Star Wars reference! :D

The build process can be seen by browsing the images directory, and videos
of moving ROSBot can be seen in the videos directory.
